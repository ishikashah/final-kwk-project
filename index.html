<p>"Fifteen were injured when the suspect, named by police as Santino William Legan, 19, opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival on the 29th of July.
Police say the suspect used an assault rifle that he purchased legally in neighbouring Nevada this month.
The gunman was shot dead by police, who are looking into a possible accomplice.
Six-year-old Stephen Romero is the first of the dead to be identified by local media. His mother and grandmother were wounded.
 None of the victims have been officially named." </p>

<p>"City manager Dave Hansen said the victims - 11 local authority workers and one contractor - "leave a void we will never be able to fill".
The gunman shot indiscriminately before dying in a gun battle with police.
He has been identified as DeWayne Craddock and described by police as a disgruntled city employee.
Authorities said they would only refer to him by name once, in order to focus attention on the victims".</p>
